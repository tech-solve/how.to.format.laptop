Has your computer recently been attacked by a virus that you can’t seem to get rid of? The only solution might be to reformat your laptop. This will completely erase the hard drive and is the most effective way to clean your computer.
Anyone can reformat their own laptop easily. Before you begin the process of reformatting your computer, you need to backup all of your information on an external hard drive or CDs and external hard drive or you will lose them

* To reset aptop, navigate to settings by clicking on the ‘gear’ icon on the start menu.
* Select the ‘Update & Security’ option from the menu
* Click on ‘Recovery’ in the left pane. Alternatively, you can use the laptop’s search option to look for the reset option
* You should see three options: Reset this PC, Go back to an earlier build, and Advanced startup. The Advanced setup option lets you boot off a recovery USB drive or disc, while “Go to an earlier build” is for Windows Insiders who want to roll back to a previous version of the OS. To start fresh, click on ‘Get Started’ under Reset this PC.
* The following options will appear on your screen: ‘Keep my files‘ and ‘Remove everything‘. The former will format your laptop without losing your personal files, whereas the ‘Remove everything’ will wipe all data from your computer including apps, settings, and personal files. Either way, all of your settings will return to their defaults and apps will be uninstalled. 
* If you wish to remove everything click on the option, followed by ‘Remove files and clean the drive’ –> Next –> Reset –> Continue. The laptop will reset and boot automatically.
* In addition to ‘Remove files and clean the drive’, Windows 10 also gives you the option to ‘Just remove my files’, which is quicker, but less secure. It’s recommended for anyone who plans to keep the laptop.
